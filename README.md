# UniRecka---University-Reviews-Web-App-in-Django
This project was done for my university thesis, therefore it's made in Polish.
The goal of this application is to help future students choose university. 
Students can browse and search universities, browse the reviews that current students or people who graduated added.
This application was made in Django framework. Bootstrap helped to create unified interface. The application is responsive to different screen sizes.

Below you can find some screenshots from my application. Feel free to ask!
